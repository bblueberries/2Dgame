## Introduction
Ghost Buster is inspired by a tag game and the Pac-Man game. The objective of the game is to collect all of the ghost to win the game.
## Rules

The control user uses in this game is W/S when scrolling the option and SPACE to confirm that option.To go back or toggle option screen while playing user can press ESC. Lastly,to move the character, the user uses WASD .After hitting the ghost, it will disappear. When there are no more ghosts left, you win!
